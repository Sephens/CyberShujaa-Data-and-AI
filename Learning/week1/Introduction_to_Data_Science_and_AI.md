## Key Definitions  

### Data Science  
- A **multidisciplinary field**.  
- Uses **scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems**.  
- Analyzes and extracts **knowledge and insights** from data.  
- Includes **ML and DL** as tools for analyzing data.  
- Focuses on **data collection, cleaning, exploration, and communication**.  

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
- A **broad field** aiming to create applications and systems that simulate **human intelligence**.  

### Machine Learning (ML)  
- A **subset of AI**.  
- Machines **learn from data**, identify patterns **without being explicitly programmed**.  

### Deep Learning  
- A **specialized subset of ML**.  
- Uses **neural networks with many layers** (deep neural networks).

## Data Science Methodology  
A **structured, cyclic process** for solving problems with data:  

1. **Business Understanding**  
   - Define the problem, align with goals.  
   - *Example*: E-commerce company reducing customer churn.  

2. **Data Understanding**  
   - Collect & explore data (EDA, quality checks).  
   - *Example*: Analyze transaction history for churn prediction.  

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Clean, transform, engineer features.  
   - *Example*: Normalize image data for a classification model.  

4. **Data Modeling**  
   - Select & train ML models (e.g., regression, neural networks).  
   - *Example*: Bank predicts loan defaults using logistic regression.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assess performance (accuracy, precision, recall).  
   - *Example*: Fraud detection model tuned for higher recall.  

6. **Model Deployment**  
   - Integrate into production (APIs, applications).  
   - *Example*: Netflix’s real-time recommendation system.  

7. **Monitoring & Maintenance**  
   - Track metrics, detect drift, retrain.  
   - *Example*: Self-driving car updates obstacle detection.  

8. **Feedback Mechanism**  
   - Refine models using user/business feedback.
