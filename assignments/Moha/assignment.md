# Question 1

The relational schema shown below is part of an inter-library loan system. Borrowers can borrow books from different libraries.

a) Express the following queries in Relational Algebra:
i. Produce a relation that shows the borrower surname, borrower number and book titles for all borrowers at the Hatton Cross branch.
ii. Produce a relation that shows the following information: borrower surname, borrower number for all borrowers that borrowed books from public libraries which have holdings above 30,000.

b) Derive the result for the following relational algebra queries:
i. π Library Branch (σ Holdings ≤50000 ∧ District= "South London" (Library))
ii. π Library Branch (σ District ≠ 'Berkshire' ∧ Holdings ≥ 100000(Library))
iii. π Borrower surname (σ Book_Title = "Coral Bridge" (Loan_Record))

c) Give a definition of query optimisation and outline how relational algebra can be used in the process of query optimisation.

d) Give an outline of the main features of Relational Calculus.

## (a) Express the following queries in Relational Algebra:

### i. Produce a relation that shows the borrower surname, borrower number and book titles for all borrowers at the Hatton Cross branch.



**Solution:**
Two basic operations are needed:
i) Selection - select (σ) all tuples from the Loan_Record relation where the Library_Branch is "Hatton Cross"

σ Library_Branch = "Hatton Cross" (Loan_Record)

ii) Projection - project (π) only the attributes needed, in this case  Borrower_Surname, Borrower_Number, and Book_Title

π Borrower_Surname, Borrower_Number, Book_Title

Combine the operations to form our relation

```
π Borrower_Surname, Borrower_Number, Book_Title (σ Library_Branch = "Hatton Cross" (Loan_Record))
```

**Our Result**
| Borrower_Surname | Borrower_Number | Book_Title       |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Lodge            | B580            | Ulysses          |
| Fisher           | B591            | Simon's Garden   |
| Fisher           | B591            | Coral Bridge     |

### ii. Produce a relation that shows borrower surname and borrower number for all borrowers that borrowed books from public libraries which have holdings above 30,000.


**Solution:**
We shall do three basic operations:
i) Selection - we select(σ) libraries that are "Public" AND (∧) have holdings above 30,000 from the Library relation

σ Library_Type = "Public" ∧ Holdings > 30000 (Library)

ii) Join - Then we Join the result gotten from the selection to the Loan Record

Loan_Record ⋈ (σ Library_Type = "Public" ∧ Holdings > 30000 (Library))

iii)Projection - We project only the values of these specified attributes -  Borrower_Surname and Borrower_Number and combine all the steps to form our relation

```
π Borrower_Surname, Borrower_Number (Loan_Record ⋈ (σ Library_Type = "Public" ∧ Holdings > 30000 (Library)))
```

**Our Result**
| Borrower_Surname | Borrower_Number |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Landis           | B602            |
| Choudhury        | B613            |
| Wu               | B624            |

## (b) Derive the  results for the following Relational Algebra Queries

### i. π Library_Branch (σ Holdings ≤50000 ∧ District= "South London" (Library))
The query states that we should derive Library branches with holdings ≤50,000 (less than or equl to 50,000) in South London

**Solution:**
1. We select libraries where Holdings ≤ 50,000 AND District = "South London"
2. According to the Library table, the matching tuples are:
   - Lewisham (Holdings: 25,000)
   - Deptford (Holdings: 60,000) does not meet the Holdings condition
3. We then project only the Library_Branch attribute - This gives us Lewisham as the only result of our condition.

**Result:**
| Library_Branch |
|----------------|
| Lewisham       |

### ii. π Library_Branch (σ District ≠ 'Berkshire' ∧ Holdings ≥ 100000(Library))
The query states that we should derive Library branches that are not in Berkshire with holdings ≥100,000 (greater than or equal to 100,100)

**Solution:**
1. We first do a selection of libraries where District ≠(not equal) "Berkshire" AND Holdings ≥ 100,000
2. According to the Library table, the only matching tuples are:
   - New Cross (South London, University, 100,000)
   - Hatton Cross (Berkshire, University, 100,000)
  
  Both of them have a Holding of 100,000 but Hatton Cross is in Berkshire which does not match the condition. Hence we remain with New Cross as the only Branch fully matching the cindition.

3. We then project only the Library_Branch attribute

**Result:**
| Library_Branch |
|----------------|
| New Cross      |

### iii. π Borrower_surname (σ Book_Title = "Coral Bridge" (Loan_Record))


The query states that we should derive Borrower surnames who borrowed Coral Bridge


**Solution:**
1. We first select loan records where Book_Title = "Coral Bridge"
2. According to the Loan_Record table, the only matching tuples are:
   - (New Cross, B580, Lodge, 1406, Coral Bridge)
   - (Hatton Cross, B591, Fisher, 1406, Coral Bridge)
3. We then project only the Borrower_surname attribute

**Result:**
| Borrower_surname |
|------------------|
| Lodge            |
| Fisher           |

## (c) Give a definition of query optimisation and outline how relational algebra can be used in the process of query optimisation.


**Definition:**
Query optimisation is the activity of choosing an efficient execution strategy for processing a query, with a goal of minimizing resource usage and response time in the process of producing desired results.



**How Relational Algebra is Used:**
1. **Query Representation:** In Query Optimisation, queries are first translated into relational algebra expressions before they are optimized for fast processing.
2. **Transformation Rules:** 

By applying transformation rules, the optimizer can transform one relational algebra expression into an equivalent expression that is known to be more efficient.

For example:
For prospective renters who are looking for flats, find the properties that match their requirements and
are owned by owner C94.
We can write this query in SQL as:

SELECT p.propertyNo, p.street
FROM Client c, Viewing v, PropertyForRent p
WHERE c.prefType 5 ‘Flat’ AND c.clientNo 5 v.clientNo AND
v.propertyNo 5 p.propertyNo AND c.maxRent .5 p.rent AND
c.prefType 5 p.type AND p.ownerNo 5 ‘C94’;

For the purposes of this example, we will assume that there are fewer properties owned by owner C94 than prospective renters who have specified a preferred property type of Flat. 

Converting the SQL to relational algebra, we have:

p.propertyNo, p.street (c.prefType5 ‘Flat’ Ù c.clientNo5v.clientNo Ù v.propertyNo5p.propertyNo Ù c.maxRent>5p.rent Ù c.prefType5p.type
Ù p.ownerNo5‘C94’((c × v) × p))

We can then use transformational rules  such as ascade of selection, and
commutativity of unary operations. This can help transform the relational algebra expression above to a more efficient expression.

3. **Cost Estimation:**
A DBMS may have many different ways of implementing the relational algebra operations. The aim of query optimisation is to choose the most efficient one.
To do this, it uses formulae that estimate the costs for a number of options and selects the one with the lowest cost
Different algebraic expressions are evaluated based on cardinality of each base relation, the number of blocks required to store a relation, the number of distinct values for each attribute e.t.c.

4. **Plan Generation:** The query optimizer generates multiple execution plans from the algebraic expressions and selects the one with lowest estimated cost. 




## (d) Give an outline of the main features of Relational Calculus.

**Definition:**
Relational calculus query specifies what is to be retrieved rather than how to retrieve it.

It comes in two forms:
1. Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)
2. Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)

**Main Features:**
1. **Declarative in Nature:** Specifies what to find without specifying how to find it.
2. **Based on Predicate Logic:** Relational Calculus uses logical expressions to define result tuples. For example, we may connect predicates by the logical connectives Ù (AND), Ú (OR), and
~ (NOT) to form compound predicates.
3. **Variables:** 
   - Tuple Relational Calculus uses tuple variables that range over a named relation.
   - Domain Relational Calculus uses domain variables that range over attribute values
4. **Quantifiers:**
   - Existential (∃): "there exists" - used in formulae that must be true for at least one instance
   - Universal (∀): "for all" - used in statements about every instance
  
5. **Formulas:** Built from atoms using logical operators (∧, ∨, ¬, →)

# Question 2

Below is a form which holds information about a sports club member, their activities and the equipment used for those activities.

a) Using the technique you are familiar with:
i) Normalise the above form to Third Normal Form (3NF). Show each of the stages of normalisation.
ii) List the resulting entities.

b) With the use of an example explain the approach you would take to deal with multi-valued dependencies during the process of normalisation.

## (a) Using the technique you are familiar with: 
**(i) Normalise the above form to Third Normal Form (3NF). Show each of the stages of normalisation**

The form above contains information about sports club members, their activities, and equipment used. We can identify the following attributes:
- Member information: Member Number, Member Name, Membership Type Code, Membership Type Name
- Activity information: Activity ID, Activity Name, Date, Price, Equipment Code, Equipment Name

### Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
We define 1NF as a relation in which the intersection of each row and column contains one and only one value
**Requirements:**
- Eliminate repeating groups
- Ensure all attributes contain atomic values
- Identify a primary key

**Problems in the initial form:**
1. Repeating groups in the activity table (multiple activities per member)
2. Equipment information is mixed with activity information

**Solution:**
There are two common approaches to removing repeating groups from unnormalized tables.
- By entering appropriate data in the empty columns of rows containing the repeating data.
- By placing the repeating data, along with a copy of the original key attribute(s), in a
separate relation.

In this case we'll go with the second option and separate the data into distinct tables with atomic values.

**Resulting Relations:**

**Member (1NF):**
| Member_Number (PK) | Member_Name | Membership_Type_Code | Membership_Type_Name |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 87976              | David Smith | FT                   | Full Time            |

**Activity (1NF):**
| Activity_ID (PK) | Activity_Name | Date     | Price | Equipment_Code | Equipment_Name           | Member_Number (FK) |
|------------------|---------------|----------|-------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| 099              | Archery       | 01/08/23 | £3    | Arc            | Archery equipment        | 87976              |
| 0100             | Swimming      | 01/08/23 | £3.50 | N              | None                     | 87976              |
| 0101             | Swimming      | 03/08/23 | £3.75 | N              | Goggles and Bathing Cap  | 87976              |
| 098              | Indoor Cycling| 06/09/23 | £3.99 | Cyc           | Cycle                    | 87976              |
| 078              | Cross country cycling | 08/09/23 | £3.99 | Cyc          | Cycle                    | 87976              |

### Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
We define a 2NF as a  relation that is in first normal form and every non-primary-key. attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key. That is we remove partial dependency.

**Requirements:**
- Must be in 1NF
- Remove partial dependencies (all non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key)

**Problems identified:**
1. In Activity table, Activity_Name depends only on Activity_ID, not the full composite key
2. Equipment_Name depends only on Equipment_Code, not the activity.
3. Member information has transitive dependencies

**Solution:**
We'll further break down the tables to remove partial dependencies.

**Resulting Tables:**

**Member (2NF):** (Same as 1NF for now)
| Member_Number (PK) | Member_Name | Membership_Type_Code | Membership_Type_Name |

**Membership_Type:**
| Membership_Type_Code (PK) | Membership_Type_Name |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| FT                        | Full Time            |

**Activity_Details:**
| Activity_ID (PK) | Activity_Name |
|------------------|---------------|
| 099              | Archery       |
| 0100             | Swimming      |
| 0101             | Swimming      |
| 098              | Indoor Cycling|
| 078              | Cross country cycling |

**Equipment:**
| Equipment_Code (PK) | Equipment_Name           |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Arc                 | Archery equipment        |
| N                   | None                     |
| N                   | Goggles and Bathing Cap  |
| Cyc               | Cycle                    |

**Member_Activity:**
| Activity_ID (PK) | Date (PK)     | Price | Member_Number (FK) | Equipment_Code (FK) |
|------------------|---------------|-------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 099              | 01/08/23      | £3    | 87976              | Arc                 |
| 0100             | 01/08/23      | £3.50 | 87976              | N                   |
| 0101             | 03/08/23      | £3.75 | 87976              | N                   |
| 098              | 06/09/23      | £3.99 | 87976              | Cyc                |
| 078              | 08/09/23      | £3.99 | 87976              | Cyc                |

### Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
We define a 3NF as a relation that is in first and second normal form and in which no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key.
**Requirements:**
- Must be in 2NF
- Remove transitive dependencies (non-key attributes must depend only on the primary key)

**Problems identified:**
1. In Member table, Membership_Type_Name depends on Membership_Type_Code, not directly on Member_Number
2. In Equipment table, there's a data anomaly with Equipment_Code 'N' having two different Equipment_Name values

**Solution:**
1. We'll remove the transitive dependency in Member table
2. We'll then fix equipment data inconsistency
3. Further normalize the tables

**Final Tables in 3NF:**

**Member:**
| Member_Number (PK) | Member_Name | Membership_Type_Code (FK) |
|--------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 87976              | David Smith | FT                        |

**Membership_Type:**
| Membership_Type_Code (PK) | Membership_Type_Name |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| FT                        | Full Time            |

**Activity_Details:**
| Activity_ID (PK) | Activity_Name |
|------------------|---------------|
| 099              | Archery       |
| 0100             | Swimming      |
| 0101             | Swimming      |
| 098              | Indoor Cycling|
| 078              | Cross country cycling |

**Equipment:**
| Equipment_Code (PK) | Equipment_Name           |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Arc                 | Archery equipment        |
| N1                  | None                     |
| N2                  | Goggles and Bathing Cap  |
| Cyc                | Cycle                    |

**Member_Activity:**
| Activity_ID (PK) | Date (PK)     | Price | Member_Number (FK) | Equipment_Code (FK) |
|------------------|---------------|-------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 099              | 01/08/23      | £3    | 87976              | Arc                 |
| 0100             | 01/08/23      | £3.50 | 87976              | N1                  |
| 0101             | 03/08/23      | £3.75 | 87976              | N2                  |
| 098              | 06/09/23      | £3.99 | 87976              | Cyc                |
| 078              | 08/09/23      | £3.99 | 87976              | Cyc                |

### (a) ii) List the resulting entities.
1. **Member** - Contains member information
2. **Membership_Type** - Contains membership type details
3. **Activity_Details** - Contains activity descriptions
4. **Equipment** - Contains equipment information
5. **Member_Activity** - Junction table linking members to their activities with additional details

### (b) With the use of an example explain the approach you would take to deal with multi-valued dependencies during the process of normalisation.

### Definition of Multi-Valued Dependency
We define Multi-Valued Dependency as a dependency between attributes (for example, A, B, and C) in a relation, such that for each value of A there is a set of values for B and a set of values for C. However, the set of values for B and C are independent of each other.

We represent a MVD between attributes A, B, and C in a relation using the following notation:
A—>> B
A—>> C

### For example from the relations above:
We can observe a potential multi-valued dependency:
- For Member 87976 (A), there are multiple activities (B) and multiple equipment items (C)
- The activities and equipment are independent of each other (the same equipment can be used for different activities)

### Approach to Handle Multi-Valued Dependencies
1. **Identify the MVD:** A —>> B and A —>> C
   - In our case: Member_Number —>> Activity_ID and Member_Number —>>Equipment_Code

2. **Decomposition Rule (4NF):**
   - Create separate tables for each multi-valued dependency
   - The original table should contain only A and any attributes functionally dependent on A

3. **Implementation:**
   - **Member_Activity:** Contains Member_Number and Activity_ID
   - **Member_Equipment:** Contains Member_Number and Equipment_Code
   - **Member:** Contains other member attributes

4. **Resulting Tables:**
   - This would be part of Fourth Normal Form (4NF) normalization
   - However, in our 3NF solution, we've handled this through the Member_Activity junction table which serves a similar purpose

In our 3NF solution, we effectively handled the multi-valued dependency by:
1. Creating separate tables for activities and equipment
2. Using a junction table (Member_Activity) that combines member, activity, and equipment information with the specific context of each activity session.

# Comprehensive Solutions to Questions 3 and 4

## Question 3: Zenner Collections Auction House

Zenner Collections is an auction house specialising in antiques. They classify items by geographic area and historical eras. Geographic areas (such as a country) are grouped into regions such as south-east Asia, north Africa etc. Historical eras each have one or more reference books associated with them. A reference book may be used for more than one historical era.

a) Draw an entity relationship diagram to reflect the information you have been given (you NEED NOT include attributes in the diagram).

b) Identify all the primary and foreign keys for this diagram.

c) Zenner Collections have decided they need to classify antique firearms (such as muskets) with extra attributes to take account of licensing issues and extra insurance when handling them. Describe how features of the Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) might be used to be able to take account of this requirement.

+---------------+       +-----------------+      +-----------------+
```

**Relationships:**
1. REGION contains multiple GEOGRAPHIC AREAs (1:N)
2. GEOGRAPHIC AREA classifies multiple ITEMs (1:N)
3. HISTORICAL ERA classifies multiple ITEMs (1:N)
4. HISTORICAL ERA is associated with multiple REFERENCE BOOKs (M:N)
5. FIREARM is a specialization of ITEM (inheritance)

### b) Primary and Foreign Keys

**Entities and Their Keys:**

1. **REGION**
   - PK: Region_ID

2. **GEOGRAPHIC_AREA**
   - PK: Area_ID
   - FK: Region_ID (references REGION)

3. **HISTORICAL_ERA**
   - PK: Era_ID

4. **REFERENCE_BOOK**
   - PK: Book_ID

5. **ERA_BOOK_ASSOCIATION** (Junction table for M:N relationship)
   - PK: Composite (Era_ID, Book_ID)
   - FK: Era_ID (references HISTORICAL_ERA)
   - FK: Book_ID (references REFERENCE_BOOK)

6. **ITEM**
   - PK: Item_ID
   - FK: Area_ID (references GEOGRAPHIC_AREA)
   - FK: Era_ID (references HISTORICAL_ERA)

7. **FIREARM** (Extended entity)
   - PK: Item_ID (same as ITEM, shared primary key)
   - FK: Item_ID (references ITEM)

### c) Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) Features for Firearms

To handle antique firearms with special requirements, we can use these EER features:

1. **Specialization/Generalization:**
   - Create FIREARM as a subclass of ITEM (superclass)
   - This represents an "IS-A" relationship (a firearm IS AN item)
   - Use inheritance to share all attributes of ITEM while adding specific ones

2. **Attribute Inheritance:**
   - FIREARM inherits all attributes of ITEM (Item_ID, description, etc.)
   - Adds specific attributes:
     - License_Required (boolean)
     - Insurance_Value (decimal)
     - Firearm_Type (enum: musket, pistol, rifle, etc.)
     - Caliber
     - Year_of_Manufacture

3. **Participation Constraints:**
   - Can specify if specialization is:
     - Total (every item must be a firearm or other subtype)
     - Partial (only some items are firearms)
   - In this case, likely partial participation

4. **Disjoint/Overlapping Constraints:**
   - Specify if subclasses are:
     - Disjoint (an item can only be one subtype)
     - Overlapping (an item can be multiple subtypes)
   - For antiques, likely disjoint (a firearm isn't also furniture)

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Maintains all item information in one hierarchy
- Allows queries across all items or just firearms

## Question 4: Foundry University Data Warehouse Assessment


Foundry University is a university based in London, UK. The university keeps student records on its Student Records System, a multi-user relational database. This has such information as the local authority that the student originated in, the type of school that they attended as well as their modules, grades and eventually their final degree classification. Once students have left, their record is kept on the live system for two years before being archived unto a Student Archive System which is a duplicate of the student record system in terms of its structure.

The Alumni (former student) Office sends out a magazine to all ex-students and keeps information about them such as what they have done since leaving the university and what their current job is. The Alumni Office has built itself a small stand-alone database, with data being gathered from a report from the Student Archive System and from a regular questionnaire it sends out to ex-students.

In order to make decisions about the allocation of resources, the government has asked that the university provide information on certain trends. The government needs to know how current students are progressing, and what sort of jobs past students got and how this is affected by such factors as their local authority, their school, and what degree subject they followed.

Critically assess the advantages and disadvantages that the implementation of a data warehouse might have for Foundry University.

### Current System Overview
1. **Operational Systems:**
   - Student Records System (live data for current students)
   - Student Archive System (historical data for alumni)

2. The current fragmentation of student data
3. The value of long-term trend analysis for resource allocation

**Implementation Considerations:**
1. **Phased Approach:**
   - Start with most critical subject areas (student progression)
   - Expand to alumni outcomes later

2. **Dimensional Model Design:**
   - Star schema with fact tables for:
     - Student enrollments
     - Course completions
     - Degree awards
     - Career outcomes
   - Dimension tables for:
     - Time
     - Students
     - Courses
     - Demographics
     - Employers

3. **Technology Selection:**
   - Consider cloud-based solutions for scalability
   - Implement proper security controls

4. **Change Management:**
   - Involve stakeholders from all departments
   - Provide training on analytical tools

**Conclusion:**
While the implementation would require significant resources, the long-term benefits for strategic decision-making and government reporting would justify the investment. The data warehouse would provide Foundry University with comprehensive insights that are impossible to obtain from the current fragmented systems.

These comprehensive solutions address all aspects of both questions, providing detailed explanations, visual representations where appropriate, and thorough analysis of the concepts involved.
