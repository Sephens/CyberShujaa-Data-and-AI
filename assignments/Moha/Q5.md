# Question 5

**Critically discuss how Gardner Learning would go about implementing web/database integration and what benefits they might derive from it**

There are various approaches available for the company to enable web and database intergration.

To address the need for the company to enable online access to course schedules, student records, learning materials, and secure payment processing, the institution can intergrate their web and database using the following approach.

**1. Use of Scripting Languages**
Scripting languages can be used to extend the browser and the Web server with database functionality.

The institution can use scripting languages such as JaveScript for client-side validation and dynamic content reloads. This will form the frontend where their students and staff will interact with the database.

They can then use PHP for server-side processing and database connectivity.

**2. Common Gateway Interface**
Gardner Learning can implement CGI by developing Python scripts to process form submissions and queries made by the students to the database. This can be much handy when it comes to real-time course information display or payment processing as required.

**3. HTTP Cookies**
Gardner Learning can utilize HTTP Cookies to maintain student login sessions or even store course preferences.This will boost user experince.

**4. Extending the Web Server**
For improved performance and interaction, Gardner Learning can use the browser  for caching information which can then be accessed faster when needed by students. They can also utilize Server APIs like Microsoftâ€™s Internet Information Server API (ISAPI) to implement filters.


**Advantages of web/database integration**

**1. Graphical user interface**
**DBMS advantages**
Many of the advantages cited for the DBMS approach are applicable for the integration of the Web and the DBMS.For example, the problem of synchronizing information in both the database and in the HTML files disappears, as the HTML pages are dynamically generated from the database.

**Simplicity**
HTML is easy to learn for both developers and end-users. This presents an advantage to the Gardner Learning institutuion as they implenent web/database intergration. They can easily build their system without much technical barrier.

**Platform independence**
The platform-independent nature of web technologies provides Gardner Learning with a universally accessible solution for integrating its database with a web-based interface. Students using different browsers are able to interact with the same database with ease

**Graphical User Interface**	
Web browsers provide a common, easy-to-use GUI that can be used to access many things, including a database. This will enable Gardner Learning to have thier courses visualy presented to their learners, reduced development complexity by utilizing already existing HTML form elements, modals, and navigation patterns. The institution will enjoy the benefit of superior database access compared to the traditional methods they had.

**Standardization**	
Due to the global standardization of web technologies, implementing web/database intergration will provide the institution with advantages such as universal accessibility through HTML standards, standardized data exchange formats such as XML and reduced technology risks such as vendor lock-in.

**Cross-platform support**
The universal availability of web browsers across many computing platforms provides the institution with the ability to deploy their database where students can interact with it from any place unlike the centralization of services that it once had. Students can access course schedules, materials and inquiries with ease.

**Transparent network access**	
This built-in support for networking greatly simplifies database access, eliminating the need for expensive networking software and the complexity of getting different platforms to talk to one another. The institution does not need to focus on complext setups and configurations in order for their data to move accross the institution. They can put this energy in ensuring that the learning outcomes is exemplified.

**Scalable deployment**
The scalable nature of the web positions the institution for future technological evolution without costly re-engineering. The three-tier model proves particularly valuable for educational institutions facing fluctuating demands and limited IT budgets by providing capabilities to meet their enterprise demands without having to change them entirely for example with the increasing number of courses.

**Innovation**
As an Internet platform, the Web enables organizations to provide new services and reach new customers through globally accessible applications. The institution will be able to provide it's services accross and beyond, unlike it's traditional nature. This will put the institution at a good place in the effort to make education access easier and of much quality.
