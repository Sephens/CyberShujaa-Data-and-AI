## Question 3

**a) Draw an entity relationship diagram to reflect the information you have been given (you NEED NOT include attributes in the diagram).**

**Entities Identified:**
1. Customer
2. Bicycle
3. Job (Service/Repair)
4. Staff
5. Component
6. Component_Type

**Relationships:**
1. Customer **owns** Bicycle (1:N)
2. Bicycle **has** Job (1:N)
3. Staff **works on** Job (M:N)
4. Job **uses** Component (M:N)
5. Component **belongs to** Component_Type (N:1)

**ERD Diagram (Crow's Foot Notation):**
```
+-----------+       +-----------+       +-------+
| Customer  |-------| Bicycle   |-------| Job   |
+-----------+ 1   N +-----------+ 1   N +-------+
                                     /    \
                                    /      \
                         +-------+ /        \ +-----------+
                         | Staff |----------| Component  |
                         +-------+ M      N +-----------+
                                              |
                                              | N
                                      +-----------------+
                                      | Component_Type  |
                                      +-----------------+
```

**Explanation:**
- Each customer can own multiple bicycles (1:N relationship)
- Each bicycle can have multiple service jobs (1:N relationship)
- Staff and jobs have a many-to-many relationship (M:N) requiring a junction table
- Jobs and components have a many-to-many relationship (M:N) requiring a junction table
- Components belong to specific types (N:1 relationship)

### Part b) The company have decided they need to classify bicycles by type since some bicycles such as electric ones have extra attributes such as the type of battery. Describe how features of the Extended Entity-Relationship modelling approach (EER) might be used to be able to take account of this requirement.

**Requirement:** Classify bicycles by type with specialized attributes (e.g., electric bikes with battery type).

**EER Features to Use:**
1. **Specialisation and Generalisation**
   Specialisation is the process of maximising the difference between members of an entity by identifying distinguishing characteristics. Generalisation is the process of minimizing the differences between entities by identifying their common characteristics. 
   - We can create a supertype "Bicycle" with common attributes and then create subtypes for different bicycle types (e.g., ElectricBike, MountainBike)

2. **Attribute Inheritance:**
   - With attribute inheritance, the subtypes can then inherit all the attributes of the supertype

3. **Disjoint Constraints:**
   With this constraint we ask the question; Can a member of a superclass be a member of more than one subclass?
   - We can therefore define whether a bicycle can belong to multiple types

4. **Participation Constraint:**
   With this constraint we as the question; Does every member of a superclass have to belong to a subclass?
   - With this we can specify whether to classify all bicycles or not
**EER Diagram Representation:**

```


**Implementation Considerations:**
1. **Supertype Primary Key:** bike_id would be primary key for all tables
2. **Subtype Tables:** Would include bike_id (FK to Bicycle) plus specialized attributes
3. **Constraints:**
   - Disjoint: {ElectricBike} ∩ {StandardBike} = ∅
   - Total: Every bicycle must be either electric or standard

**Benefits:**
- Maintains data integrity for specialized bike types
- Avoids null values in a single table design
- Clear semantic representation of bicycle categories
- Easier to extend with new bike types in future
