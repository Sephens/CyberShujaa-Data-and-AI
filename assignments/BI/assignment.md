## **1. Introduction**  
The goal of this assignment is to analyze hotel business data to understand client needs and support decision-making. The tasks include:  
- Loading and transforming datasets (e.g., `dim_date`, `dim_rooms`, `dim_hotels`, `fact_bookings`).  The dimensions and fact tables
- Building a **star schema** data model with proper relationships.  
- Creating **DAX measures and columns** for analysis.  
- Designing an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  
- Publishing the report and documenting the process.  

This report provides a step-by-step walkthrough with screenshots as evidence of completion.

## **2. Task Completion**  

### **2.1 Data Loading & Transformation**  
I imported the following datasets into Power BI:  
- `dim_date` (date dimension)  
- `dim_rooms` (room details) 
- `dim_hotels` (hotels details) 
- `fact_bookings` (booking transactions) 
- `fact_aggregated_bookings` (aggregated booking transactions) 

**Steps:** 
 
1. Launched Power BI Desktop
2. Clicked **"Get Data"** → Selected **More** → **Folder**(containing all the dimension and fact tables). → **Connect**
3. Applied transformations in **Power Query Editor**:  
   - Removed duplicates.  
   - Corrected data types (e.g., date formats).  
   - Handled missing values.

### **2.2 Building the Data Model (Star Schema)**  
I structured the data model with:  
- **Fact table:** `fact_bookings` (central table with transactional data).  
- **Dimension tables:** `dim_date`, `dim_rooms`, `dim_customers` (linked via relationships).  

**Relationships:**  
- `fact_bookings[room_id]` → `dim_rooms[room_id]` (One-to-Many)  
- `fact_bookings[booking_date]` → `dim_date[date]` (One-to-Many)  

**Screenshot:**

### **2.3 DAX Measures & Columns**  
I created the following **DAX** calculations:  

#### **New Columns:**  
1. **`Revenue`** (for each booking):  
   ```dax
   Revenue = fact_bookings[price_per_night] * fact_bookings[stay_duration]  
   ```

#### **Key Measures:**  
2. **`Total Revenue`**:  
   ```dax
   Total Revenue = SUM(fact_bookings[Revenue])  
   ```
3. **`Occupancy Rate`**:  
   ```dax
   Occupancy Rate = 
   DIVIDE(
       COUNTROWS(fact_bookings),
       COUNTROWS(dim_rooms),
       0
   )
   ```
4. **`Average Stay Duration`**:  
   ```dax
   Avg Stay Duration = AVERAGE(fact_bookings[stay_duration])  
   ```

**Screenshot:**

### **2.4 Interactive Dashboard**  
I designed a **4-page dashboard** with:  
- **Revenue Trends** (Line chart by month).  
- **Room Occupancy** (Heatmap by room type).  
- **Customer Segmentation** (Pie chart by customer type).  
- **Filters** (Date range, room category).  

**Screenshot:**  
*(Insert dashboard screenshot with visuals and filters)*

### **2.5 Publishing & Sharing**  
1. Clicked **"Publish"** to Power BI Service.  
2. Shared the report with **public access**.  
3. Embedded it in my **[portfolio/blog link]**.  

**Screenshot:**

# **Comprehensive Hotel Business Analytics Solution in Power BI**

## **1. Project Overview**
This solution provides an end-to-end analysis of hotel booking data to optimize operations, maximize revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction. The implementation covers data preparation, modeling, advanced analytics, and interactive visualization.

## **2. Detailed Implementation**

### **2.1 Data Preparation & Transformation**

**Datasets Processed:**
- `dim_date.csv` (Date dimension)
- `dim_rooms.xlsx` (Room inventory)
- `fact_bookings.json` (Transactional records)
- `dim_customers.csv` (Guest profiles)

**Advanced Data Cleaning:**
1. **Temporal Alignment:**
   - Created custom date hierarchy (Year → Quarter → Month → Day)
   - Standardized time zones across booking records
   ```powerquery
   DateTimeZone.SwitchZone([checkin_time], -5) // EST conversion
   ```

2. **Room Data Enhancement:**
   - Calculated room square footage from dimensions
   - Derived amenity flags from description text
   ```powerquery
   if Text.Contains([description], "Ocean View") then "Yes" else "No"
   ```

3. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
   - Created loyalty tiers based on booking history

### **2.2 Sophisticated Data Modeling**

**Optimized Star Schema:**
- **Fact Tables:**
  - `fact_bookings` (core transactions)
  - `fact_service_usage` (ancillary services)

- **Dimension Tables:**
  - `dim_rooms` (with SCD Type 2 for room changes)
  - `dim_customers` (with hierarchy for corporate accounts)
  - `dim_date` (with fiscal calendar)

**Relationship Configuration:**
- Implemented bi-directional filtering for service analysis
- Set up inactive relationships for time intelligence
- Created bridge tables for many-to-many relationships

### **2.3 Advanced DAX Implementation**

**Time Intelligence:**
```dax
YoY Revenue Growth = 
VAR CurrentRevenue = [Total Revenue]
VAR PriorYearRevenue = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Revenue],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(dim_date[date])
    )
RETURN
    DIVIDE(CurrentRevenue - PriorYearRevenue, PriorYearRevenue, 0)
```

**Predictive Measures:**
```dax
Expected Occupancy = 
VAR SeasonalityFactor = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        MONTH(MAX(dim_date[date])) IN {6,7,8}, 1.25,
        MONTH(MAX(dim_date[date])) IN {12,1}, 1.15,
        1
    )
VAR BaseOccupancy = [Occupancy Rate]
RETURN
    BaseOccupancy * SeasonalityFactor
```

**What-If Analysis:**
```dax
Price Sensitivity = 
VAR PriceChange = SELECTEDVALUE('Price Adjustment'[Adjustment], 0)
RETURN
    [Total Revenue] * (1 + PriceChange) * 
    (1 - (ABS(PriceChange) * 0.2)) // Elasticity factor
```
